-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=miyagi-studio039s-tohoku-earthquake-memorial-anime-short-streamed---news>Miyagi Studio's Tohoku Earthquake Memorial Anime Short Streamed - News<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#miyagi-studio039s-tohoku-earthquake-memorial-anime-short-streamed---news>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/crop600x315/cms/news/85248/quakeanime.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.cVy3rI6jRBkv401IQGroxAHaD4&pid=15.1"' alt="Miyagi Studio's Tohoku Earthquake Memorial Anime Short Streamed - News"><p><em>Source: animenewsnetwork.com</em></p><blockquote><p>anime earthquake.</p></blockquote><p>The History of Wallpapers: From Ancient Times to Today
